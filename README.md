# Calculator-with-GUI-using-Python

This Project requiers PyQt5 module

  If the Program doesn't run then try install the following pip module :-
  # pip install PyQt5

# WORK IN PROGRESS

This Project was inspired by https://github.com/Uttkarsh09/3.14thon-PROjects/blob/master/calculator.py
After this I'm never going to do any Python Projects with GUI..yea python sucks in gui but i really like the performance.

Hit me Up! if you are willing to help and to make it better!
